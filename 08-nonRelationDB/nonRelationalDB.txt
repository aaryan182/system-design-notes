It is a very broad generalization of databases that are non relational(MySQL, PostgresSQL etc) but this does not mean all non relational databases are similar.

What makes Non relational databases interesting ? 
Most non relational databases shard out of the box 
                    Horizontal Scalability


3 important types of nosql databases

Document DBs => MongoDB, Elastic search
    - Mostly JSON based
    - Supports complex queries ( almost like relational sql databases )
    - Parital updates to document possible
    - closest to relational DB


Key Value Stores: Redis, DynamoDB, Aerospike

- extremely simple databases
- Limited functionalities (GET, PUT, DEL)
- Meant for key based access pattern
- does not support complex queries(aggregations)
- can be heavily sharded and partitioned
- use case: profile data, order data, auth data, messages etc

We can use relational databases and document DBs as KV Stores


Graph Databases ( Neo4j, Neptune, Dgraph)

What if our graph data structure had a database 
- it stores data that are represented as nodes, edges and relations 
- great for running complex graph algorithms
- powerful to model social networks , recommendations and fraud detection
