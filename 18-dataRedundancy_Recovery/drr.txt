API Servers are "stateless" but databases are "stateful".

API servers going down is fine because a new one will be spin up almost instantly. API server gets request and it does not matter which one handles it . 

Databases going down is catastrophic almost always on outage!
Worst disk crash leading to loss of data!

A good system always take care of such catastrophic situations.

The only way to protect ourselves against loss of data is to create multiple copies of it. -> data redundancy 

Redundancy can be implemented at row/document level, table level or DB level . 
Redundant data can be sorted on different table, different DB or different region.

Backup and restore: 
- daily backup of data (incremental backup)
- weekly complete backup 
- storing one copy across region (disaster recovery)
- when something goes wrong just restore the last backup 
- almost always the easiest thing to do 


Continous Redundancy: 
setup replica of the database and writes go to both DB(sync/async)

1) API server writing to both DB 
2) API writes to one and is copied to other asynchronously 

* if the main DB goes down replica can take over and write to it.(almost instantly)

Note: this replica may just be a stand by and not serve any production traffic
