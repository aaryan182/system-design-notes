Sharding: method of distributing data across multiple machines.
Partitioning: splitting a subset of data within the same instance

How a database is scaled?
A database server is just a database process(mysqld, mongod) running on an EC2 instance.

We put our database in production serving real traffic.

We are getting more users that we DB is unable to manage we scale up our DB , give it more CPU, RAM and DISK

Our Product went viral and our bulky database is unable to handle the load, so we scale up again.

But after a cetain stage we know we would not be able to scale up our DV because vertical scaling is physical limitation.

So we will have to resort to horizontal scaling.

Say one DB server was handling 1000WPS and we cannot scale up beyond that but we are getting 1500 WPS we scale horizontally and split the data.

By adding one more database server, we reduced the loas to 750WPS on each node and thus handled higher throughput.

Each database server is thus a shard and we say that the data is partitioned. Overall a database is sharded while the data is partitioned.


Overall  a database is sharded while the data is partitioned.


How to partition the data ?
There are two categories of data partitioning:
Horizontal partitioning, Vertical partitioning



Advantages of sharding: handle large reads and writes, increase overall storage capacity, higher availability 

Disadvantages of sharding: operationally complex , cross shared queries expensive
