Caches are anything that helps you avoid an expensive network I/O, disk I/O or computation.

1) API call to get profile information
2) Reading a specific line from a file
3) doing multiple table joins

Store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location

user -> api -> (fetches data if avaliable in cache) -> then goes to db if not present in cache

cache checked first, caches are faster and expensive 

We donot cache all the data ( just a subset of it which is most liked to be accessed)

Caches that we typically use: redis, memcached 

Note: Caches are not restricted to RAM based storage.
Any storage that is nearer and helps us avoid something expensive is a cache for us.

In the simplest form , caches are just glorified hash tables.
Some examples: 
1) Google news: most recent news news articles are more likely to be accessed hence served from cache.

2) Auth tokens: Authentication are cached in cache to avoid load on database
[tokens are checked on every request]

3) Live stream: Last 10 min of live stream is cached on CDN as it will be accessed the most
