Asynchronous Processing 
User sent the request and we immediately handle it synchronously

Example: loading insta feed is synchronous, login on website is synchronous, payments are synchronous

Most interactions on web are synchronous

Somethings that should not be synchronous: 
spinning a virtual machine: spinning up vm takes minutes and user will not wait on the same page waiting for the response.

Instead the user would love around and keep checking status once in a while. This is asynchronous.

Client -> API -> DB -> Broker -> worker 
                              -> worker
                              -> worker
then update DB and return to client

 
Message Queues: 

Brokers help two services/ applicaitons communicate through messages. We use message brokers when we want to do something asynchronously.

1) Long running task 
2) Trigger dependent tasks across machines

Example: Video Processing

Message Queues are also called as Message Brokers

Features of Message Broker: 
1) Brokers help us connect different sub - systems 

2) Brokers act as a buffer for the messages 
that is consumers can consume at their own pace. ( no synchronous load on connected systems )

example: notification system 


3) Brokers can retain messages for "n" days (depends on broker we use )
4) Brokers can re-queue the message if not deleted .

example: consumer read the message but before it would delete it crashed 


example: Auto subtitle ( auto captioning)

1) user uploads video to S3 through video service 
2) video service puts a message(after upload completes)  to broker
3) and returns response to the user 
    user sees upload complete
4) message is asynchronously read by 'captioner' service
5) captioner downloads the video
6) captioner generates captions and updates in the DB
7) user now sees caption button enabled
