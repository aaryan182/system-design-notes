Relational databases provides ACID guarantees and I in ACID is isolation and isolation levels helps us tune them.

Isolation levels dictate how much one transaction knows about the other.

Repeatable Read => COnsistent reads within same transaction 
even if other transaction committed 1st transaction would not see the changes (if value already read). It is default.

Read Committed => Reads within the same transcation always reads fresh value 
consequence: mulitple reads within the same transacation are inconsistent

Read Uncommitted => reads even Uncommitted values from other transactions
"dirty read"

Serializable => Every read is a locking read and while one transacation read, others will have to wait. It depends on engine.
