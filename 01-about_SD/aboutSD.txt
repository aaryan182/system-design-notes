What is system Design?

Set of requirements -> 

decide architecture, 
decide components, 
decide modules


How the above three interact with each other => To solve the problem  => It is almost Product Development


Every single tech product is a system this has been designed. Companies are building product and need we all to design it.

What to do when we design a system?
- break down problem statement into solvable sub problems
- decide on key components and responsibilities
- decide on boundaries of each components
- touch upon key challenges in scaling it
- make our architecture faulttolerant and available
