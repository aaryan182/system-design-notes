Circuit Breakers prevent cascading failures.

Say , we are building social network that serves feed for a user 
1) user's request comes to feed service
2) feed service pull some info from recommendation some from trending 
3) recommendation and trending both relies on profile service => to get profile detail of user who made the post 
4) recommendation and trending depends on past service => to get details of the post 

There are lots of other servives that depend on profile service.

If profile service DB is overwhelmed it slows down and transitively all services dependent on it are affected.

1. complete outage
2. unresponsiveness


Idea: What if we make call to a service only if it is healthy?
This is a Circuit breaker. wE break the circuit down when we see the failure cascade 

Circuit breakers prevent entire product from collapsing by preventing cascading failures

How is it implemented?
A common database holds the settings for each breaker.
services before making calls to others checks the config -> cache the config to avoid checking the DB

circuit breake DB 

In case of outage of service , we mark the service as unhealthy and dont make calls to it.
