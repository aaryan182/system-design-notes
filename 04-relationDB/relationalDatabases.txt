Databases are most critical component of any system. They make or break a system.

Data is stored & represented in rows and columns.

Relational Databases provides Transactions

ACID
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Atomicity : All statements witin a transaction takes effect or none
Consistency :  data will never go incorrect no matter what, constraints, cascades, triggers 
Durability: whene transactions commits the changes outlives 
Isolation: when multiple transacations are executing parallely the isolation level determines how much changes of one transaction are visible to other

Isolation has 4 levels

We pick Relational databases for relations and acid.
