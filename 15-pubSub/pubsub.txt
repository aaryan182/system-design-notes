Both message brokers and message streams requires consumers to "pull" the messages out. 

Advantage: consumers can pull at their own pace , consumers do not get ovewhelmed by messages.

Disadvantage: consumption log when high ingestion.

Realtime PubSub - makes things reactive instead of continous polling 

what if we want low latency & zero lag? => realtime pubsub


Instead of consumers pulling the message, the message is pushed to them. 
eg redis pubsub


This way we get really fast delivery time but it can overwhelm the consumers.
-> what if consumers recieve messages faster than they could process?

usecase: message broadcast, configuration push 

All server recieves updates without polling for data.
