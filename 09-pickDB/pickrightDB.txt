Picking the right Database

Each kind of database picks a segment with a slight overlap 

Common misconception: picking non relational DB because relational database do not scale

Why non relational DBs scale?
- There are no relations and constraints
- Data is modelled to be sharded (split across multiple nodes)

If we relax above on relational DB we can scale this too

- do not use foreign key
- do not use cross shard transaction
- do manual sharding


Does this mena no DB is different?
No every single db has some peculiar properties and guarantees and if you need those we pick that DB

How does this help in designing system?
while designing any system do not jump to a particular DB right away
1) understand what data you are storing
2) understand how much of data you will be storing
3) understand how you will be accessing the data
4) what kind of queries you will be firing
5) any special feature you expect 
    eg: expiration


How to pick the right DB? 
if data can fit on a single node 
 you need strong consistency? & data correctness is important 
    go for relational databases (eg  for payment transaction)

you need complex queries, aggregations
    go for non relational databases

you access is KV based but need it to be really fast
    go for redis

you need advanced data structures & algorithms 
    go for redis



if data cannot fit on one node 

you have expertise in SQL and can do manual sharding
drop constraints and go for relational databases

you have simple KV based access
go for KV store like DDB, mongoDB

if you require sophisticated graph algorithms
go for graph DB like neo4j

if you have nothing specific 
go for document DB like mongoDB
