Bloom Filters

Bloom Filter are approximate data structures that says with 100% certainity that an element does not belong to a set. It is also a probabilistic data structure. 

For example: Instagram want to recommend reels but it does not want to recommend something you saw already. 

Naive way: keep track of everything that a user saw in a set. 

people watch 100s of reels every single day over time the set of all post watch by a user will be huge 

So what? To check the existence of a key in set we have to load the entire set in memory and then check. (super expensive and time consuming )

Key insight: Once something is "watched" we cannot take it back (once a post/reel is watched by us we do not take it out of the set )

This means storing actual data is not worth it. This is the concep over which the bloom filters are built.


Bloom filter : Filter ~~ bit array (eg: we take 8 bit array )

Space Efficiency: Bloom filters take significantly less space to hold the information and is very efficient in checking existence (it does not store keys)(just an array lookup)

False Positivity Rate: As number of keys use put in bloom filter increases the false positivity rate increases. (says key is present but in reality it is not)


Hence when # keys increases, we have to re create bloom filter with larger size and populate the keys again 
- estimate the max keys and provision a large one to start with. 

Formula =>  P = ( 1 - e ^ (-n * m)) ^ k

Practical Bloom filter : we do not have to reimplement bloom filter. There are libraries in every single language . Redis has it as one of it core features.



Practical Application : use it whenever we insert but not remove data , we need a NO with 100% certainity , having false positive is okay 

eg medium recommendation , web crawler, feed generation, tinder feed
