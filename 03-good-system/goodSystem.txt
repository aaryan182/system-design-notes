How do we know that we have built a good system?

Every system is "infinitely" buildable and hence knowing when to stop the evolution is important 

Key pointers that will help:
1) we broke our system into components
2) every component has a clear set of responsibilities(exclusive)
3) for each component we have slight technincal details figuered out
4) each component (in isolation) is:
scalable(horizontally), fault tolerant, available
