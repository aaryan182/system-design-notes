Load Balancers 

Important component in distributed systems that make it easy to scale the load horizontally. 

Load balancer is the only point of contact. 
Every load balancer has either 
1) Static IP 
2) Static DNS name 

It allows clients to talk to it (users/ servers)


client -> LB -> servers

Load Balancer hides the #servers that are "behind" it
allowing us to add many servers as possible => Horizontal scalability

Without client knowing about it: 
Request response flow: 
1) client already has IP/domain of load balancer 
    eg: auth.example.com

2) client makes API call and it comes to load balancer 
    eg: GET auth.example.com/login

3) load balancer picks one server and makes the same Request
4) load balancer gets the response from the server 
5) load balancer responds back to the client 


Job of the load balancer is to "balance" the load. It depends on how it picks teh server to forward the request. (configurable)


Load balancing Algorithms : 

Round Robin 
Distribute the load iteratively 

Weighted Round Robin:
Distribute the load iteratively but as per weights 

Least connections: pick the server having the least connections from the load balancer  
when response time has a big variance 



Hash Based Routing: (random enough)
Hash of some attribute 
(ip, user id, url) determines which server to pick 


Key Advantages of Load Balancers:
scalability: with more servers behind load balancer we can now handle more requests.

availability: even if one of the servers crash, it does not take down our entire system. Load balancer will forward request to other healthy servers. Improving the availability of the system.
