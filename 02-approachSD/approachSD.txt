How to approach System Design?

System Design is extremely practical and there is a structured way to tackle the situations.

Take small steps always.

Understand the problem statement :
without having a thorough understanding of the problem at hand we would easily digress

Break it down into components: to start with
do not create components for the sake of it 
create component that you know are must

Dissect each component ( if required)

For each sub component look into:

Database and caching, scaling and fault tolerance, async processing(delegation), communication

Repeat above for each sub component one by one

Add more sub components if needed
